## 1. Project Overview: :smile:
Hey guys, this project is a website designed for a fictional Fintech company "FinBase". This website is primarily an informative platform where the company's range products and services  are showcased in vibrant color. It consists of a Visually appealing homepage and an FAQ page, which includes a convenient email input box for user inquiries.

## 2. Why I built this :question:
The aim of this project was to Push the limits of my understanding of **Responsive Design** and the **Mobile first** design approach by leveraging on the capabilities of Flexbox  layouts and its associated properties, the `position` and `Transform` properties, CSS **Media Queries** and other responsive design techniques.  
 
My penultimate goal here was to create a website that is not only visually appealing on large screens but also on smaller screens (Mobile devices).

## 3. What I learned while building this Project

- Not every element on a webpage requires an explicit height, because element will grow according to their content.
- I got comfortable using the `order` property; parent elements must have a `display` property value set to `flex`. `.flex-items` with smaller `order` values will appear first, even negative values are valid inputs for the `order` property.
- Figured out how to ensure that the width of the main content of my webpage remains consistent at every section by creating a `.main-wrapper` reusable  `class` and setting a `width` and `max-width` property on it to ensure this and us it as a modifier class for all the sections on my webpage.
- I learned about the importance of using `comments` and how they make your code readable and maintainable in the long run.

- How the mobile first approach reduces the lines of code you write. by write the bulk of your code with smaller screens in mind and changing the layouts wit relatively fewer lines of code in your **Media Queries**

-  I learned how create visually appealing buttons that have icon images within by making use of the `inline-flex` property.
